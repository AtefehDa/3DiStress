# 3DiStress
3D Finite Element simulation for geological stress modelling

Please install the required packages specified in "requirements.txt" to run this program.

This program takes the discritised geometry (mesh) of a coal seam, apply appropriate boundary conditions and obtain the stress distribution across the whole domain using Finite Element Analysis.
